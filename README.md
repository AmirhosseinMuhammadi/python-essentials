# Python Essentials
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook covering fundamental Python programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented programming.

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed Python learning resource organized as a Jupyter notebook (`python_essentials.ipynb`). It serves as a complete guide for beginners and a reference for experienced developers looking to refresh their Python knowledge.

## Core Python Concepts
- Getting Started: Installation, running Python scripts, and basic syntax
- Variables & Data Types: Dynamic typing, naming conventions, and built-in data types
- Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, identity, membership, and bitwise operators
- Type Conversion: Casting between different data types
- Comments: Code documentation and best practices

## Control Structures
- Conditions: if, elif, else statements and match-case (Python 3.10+)
- Loops: for and while loops with break, continue, and else clauses

## Data Structures
- Lists: Ordered, mutable sequences
- Tuples: Ordered, immutable sequences
- Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
- Strings: Immutable character sequences

## Functions & Modularity
- User-defined Functions: Creating reusable code blocks
- Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions for concise operations
- Type Hints: Optional type annotations
- Variable-length Arguments: *args and **kwargs
- Python Modules: Code organization and reuse

## Advanced Topics
- File Handling: Reading and writing various file formats
- Exception Handling: Error management with try, except, finally
- Functional Programming: Pure functions, higher-order functions, decorators
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- Packaging: Project structure and virtual environments

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab

## Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmirhosseinMuhammadi/representation-learning-foundations.git

4. Python Operators - Complete operator reference
5. Type Conversion - Casting between data types
6. Comments - Code documentation
7. Conditions - Decision making with if-elif-else and match-case
8. Loops - Iteration with for and while loops
9. Built-in Data Structures - Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings
10. User-defined Functions - Creating and using functions
11. Python Modules - Code organization and standard library
12. File Handling - Reading/writing files and different formats
13. Exceptions and Error Handling - Robust error management
14. Functional Programming - Functional programming paradigms]
15. Fundamentals of OOP - Object-oriented programming concepts
16. Packaging - Project structure and best practices
